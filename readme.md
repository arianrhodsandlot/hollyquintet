## What it does

Quintet is a web app used for searching albums' covers from a series of music websites.

All results are picked from [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp). In fact, it's just like a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) of the search results of "`site:itunes.apple.com/us your-key-words`" or `"site:amazone.com your-key-words`".
